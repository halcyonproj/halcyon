# Halcyon Security Policy

Version: **v1.0 (2026-01-01)**

## Supported Versions

We currently support the last 3 minor versions of Halcyon with security and bug fixes.

We regularly perform patch releases for supported versions, which contain fixes for
security vulnerabilities as well as important bugs. Prior releases might receive
critical security fixes on best effort basis; however, it is not guaranteed that
security fixes get back-ported to unsupported versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in Halcyon, please report it responsibly,
giving us time to investigate and fix the problem.
We’ll do our best to respond quickly and work with you on a solution; however,
it may take a bit longer at times, so we appreciate your patience.

Security advisories are published via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/halcyonproj/halcyon/security/advisories)
to ensure our userbase is abreast of such issues.
